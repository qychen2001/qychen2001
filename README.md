# üëã Welcome to my Github!

**Aspiring to be an outstanding researcher and a proficient full-stack engineer.**

**Seeking passionate full stack developers at Zhejiang University! Do something interesting together.**

## üìÑ Bio

My name is Qiyuan Chen (ÈôàÂêØÊ∫ê) and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) and [Dr. Jintai Chen](https://whatashot.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University, under the guidance of [Prof. Bo Li](http://maths.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1040/18436.htm) and [Dr. Haitong Yang](http://cs.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1158/2237.htm).

Since June 2023, I've been working as a full stack and AI research intern at WeDoctor AI Lab, under the mentorship of [Shengyang Kong](https://github.com/xxweimei). I am also a member of the Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Medical Imaging Artificial Intelligence.

My current research interests primarily include: **<span style="color:#8ECFC9">Machine Learning (ML)</span>**, **<span style="color:#82B0D2">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>** and **<span style="color:#FA7F6F">Multi Modal Learning (MM)</span>**. Specifically,

- Natural Language Processing in Low Resource Scenarios
- Interpretability and Optimization of Large Language Models
- Statistical Methods for Deep Learning and Tabular Data Prediction
- Multi Modal Learning and its Applications in Medical
  
**Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!**

And I work really closely with [Qian Shao](https://abeier87.github.io/), [Hongsen Huang](https://github.com/SirlyDreamer) and [Zepeng Li](https://lzzppp.github.io/).

In my spare time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using FastAPI and Vue.js, and I'm also interested in DevOPS (CI/CD, container, etc.). If you're interested, check out my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/qychen2001).

I also enjoy digital devices (mechanical keyboards, NAS, etc.), badminton, running and chess in my spare time.
