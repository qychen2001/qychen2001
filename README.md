# 👋 Welcome to my Github!

**Aspiring to be an outstanding researcher and a proficient full-stack engineer.**

**Seeking passionate full stack developers at Zhejiang University! Do something interesting together.**

## 📄 Bio

My name is Qiyuan Chen (陈启源) and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Jian Wu and Dr. Jintai Chen. Before that, I got my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University, under the guidance of Prof. Bo Li and Dr. Haitong Yang.

Since June 2023, I’ve been working as a full stack and AI research intern at WeDoctor AI Lab, under the mentorship of Shengyang Kong. I am also a member of the Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Medical Imaging Artificial Intelligence.

My current research interests primarily include:** Machine Learning (ML)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Multi Modal Learning (MM)**. Specifically,

- Natural Language Processing in Low Resource Scenarios
- Interpretability and Optimization of Large Language Models
- Statistical Methods for Deep Learning and Tabular Data Prediction
- Multi Modal Learning and its Applications in Medical
- Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!

And I work really closely with Qian Shao, Hongsen Huang and Zepeng Li.

In my spare time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using FastAPI and Vue.js, and I’m also interested in DevOPS (CI/CD, container, etc.). If you’re interested, check out my projects on my GitHub.

I also enjoy digital devices (mechanical keyboards, NAS, etc.), badminton, running and chess in my spare time.
